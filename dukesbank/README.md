# Duke's Bank — stubborn E2E

Indexes the **external** [Duke's Bank](https://github.com/jiananwang/dukesbank) bank module via `scip-java` and emits LLM context for migration tasks (e.g. `AccountControllerBean` → Spring service).

This is the **formal runbook** for Duke's Bank LLM context. See also [migration-bridge](../migration-bridge/).

Tier policy matches the rest of the program: Docker is the canonical cross-platform path, WSL/bash is the fast local path, and PowerShell stays as a thin fallback launcher on Windows.

## Layout contract

```
github/   (or C:\github\)
├── stubborn-ai/stubborn-demo/dukesbank/       ← this folder (metadata output only)
└── dukesbank/
    └── src/j2eetutorial14/examples/bank/     ← Java sources indexed by scip-java
```

Optional cross-program runbook: [anchor-migration/demo-dukesbank](https://github.com/anchor-migration/demo-dukesbank) Step 7.

## Quick start (host)

Requires JDK, Maven, `scip-java`, and `stubborn` on PATH:

```bash
cd dukesbank
./scripts/run-e2e.sh
python3 ../scripts/verify_dukesbank_context.py
```

## Docker

From `stubborn-demo` repo root (mounts sibling `dukesbank` at `/bank`):

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm dukesbank-e2e
```

Set `DUKESBANK_ROOT` if the bank module is not at `../../dukesbank/...` relative to this repo.

## Artifacts

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `metadata/symbols.db` | SCIP symbol graph (gitignored) |
| `metadata/account-controller.stub.java` | Default `java-stub` context |
| `metadata/account-controller.stubborn-dsl` | Optional compact graph |

## Program integration

For optional anchor-migration program integration, see the Stubborn hub docs.
